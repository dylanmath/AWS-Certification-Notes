AWS Exam Prep

Global Infrastructure

Region = geographical area, each region has at least 2 availability zones
Availability Zone (AZ) = a data centre or a collection of data centres
Edge Location = Content Delivery Network endpoint for cloudfront, meaning its a way to cache the content to an endpoint

Network and Content Delivery 

    VPC = virtual private cloud, virtual data centre where you can deploy assets, multiple VPCs per region

    HIGHLY important part of exams - will know how to build a VPC from memory

    Route53 = AWS DNS service

    Cloudfront = edge locations for caching content

    Direct Connect = connecting to AWS via dedicated telephone lines from non-AWS locations

    EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud, virutal machines in the cloud that run on AWS 
    EC2 Container Service (ECS) = scalable docker container management services

    Elastic Beanstalk = 

    Lambda = serverless compute for running code, responding to events

    Lightsail = out of the box cloud, e.g. Wordpress, will be deployed automatically (for people who don't know how to use AWS)

    S3 = Simple Storage Service, virtual disk in the cloud that can store objects

    Glacier = place to archive S3 files, large files not referenced, extremely low cost, store files for compliance reasons, 3-4 hours to retrieve

    EFS Elastic File Service = file based storage that you can share, e.g. install apps, dbs, sharing volume with multiple machines 

    EBS = Elastic Block Store 

    Storage Gateway = way to connect S3 to on-prem data storage 

Databases

    RDS = Relational Database Service, mysql, postgres, sqlserver, oracle, mariadb, aurora (mysql & prostgres)
    DynamoDB = non relational database, nosql, highly scalable, high performance
    Redshift = data warehousing solution for AWS, used for reporting, queries etc. 
    Elastic Cache = way to cache data in the cloud, takes load of database

Migration services

    Snowball (import/export) = enterprise level, terabites, breifcase sized appliance, storage, load data onto appliance then send back to AWS
    Snowball Edge = not just appliance, adding compute capacity to the appliance, an on prem piece of AWS data centre
    DMS (database migration services) = migrate on prem databases onto AWS cloud, or onto other regions, other types of databases, no downtime, can move from oracle to aurora DMS handles the conversion process
    SMS Server Migration Services = same as DMS, but targets virtual machines, specifically VMWare, replicates VMs upto the AWS cloud

Analytics

    Athena = run SQL queries on S3, eg. query csv files
    EMR (elastic map reduce) = big data processing, process large amounts of data, logs analysis etc. hadoop/spark/presto
    CLoud Search = search engine for website or application, fully managed by AWS 
    Elastic Search = search engine for website or application, open source 
    Kinesis = streaming and analysing real time data at scale, e.g. financial transactions, social media streams
    Data Pipeline = service that allows to move data from one place to another, eg. move data from S3 to DynamoDB
    Quick Sight = busienss analytics tool (BI) dashboards for analyzing business data
