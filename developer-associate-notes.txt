AWS Exam Prep

Global Infrastructure

Region = geographical area, each region has at least 2 availability zones (16 regions asat Feb17)
Availability Zone (AZ) = a data centre or a collection of data centres, Availability Zones are distinct locations within an AWS region that are engineered to be isolated from failures.
Edge Location = Content Delivery Network endpoint for cloudfront, meaning its a way to cache the content to an endpoint

Network and Content Delivery 

    VPC = virtual private cloud, virtual data centre where you can deploy assets, multiple VPCs per region

    HIGHLY important part of exams - will know how to build a VPC from memory

    Route53 = AWS DNS service

    Cloudfront = edge locations for caching content

    Direct Connect = connecting to AWS via dedicated telephone lines from non-AWS locations

    EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud, virutal machines in the cloud that run on AWS 
    EC2 Container Service (ECS) = scalable docker container management services

    Elastic Beanstalk = 

    Lambda = serverless compute for running code, responding to events

    Lightsail = out of the box cloud, e.g. Wordpress, will be deployed automatically (for people who don't know how to use AWS)

    S3 = Simple Storage Service, virtual disk in the cloud that can store objects

    Glacier = place to archive S3 files, large files not referenced, extremely low cost, store files for compliance reasons, 3-4 hours to retrieve

    EFS Elastic File Service = file based storage that you can share, e.g. install apps, dbs, sharing volume with multiple machines 

    EBS = Elastic Block Store 

    Storage Gateway = way to connect S3 to on-prem data storage 

Databases

    RDS = Relational Database Service, mysql, postgres, sqlserver, oracle, mariadb, aurora (mysql & prostgres)
    DynamoDB = non relational database, nosql, highly scalable, high performance
    Redshift = data warehousing solution for AWS, used for reporting, queries etc. 
    Elastic Cache = way to cache data in the cloud, takes load of database

Migration services

    Snowball (import/export) = enterprise level, terabites, breifcase sized appliance, storage, load data onto appliance then send back to AWS
    Snowball Edge = not just appliance, adding compute capacity to the appliance, an on prem piece of AWS data centre
    DMS (database migration services) = migrate on prem databases onto AWS cloud, or onto other regions, other types of databases, no downtime, can move from oracle to aurora DMS handles the conversion process
    SMS Server Migration Services = same as DMS, but targets virtual machines, specifically VMWare, replicates VMs upto the AWS cloud

Analytics

    Athena = run SQL queries on S3, eg. query csv files
    EMR (elastic map reduce) = big data processing, process large amounts of data, logs analysis etc. hadoop/spark/presto
    CLoud Search = search engine for website or application, fully managed by AWS 
    Elastic Search = search engine for website or application, open source 
    Kinesis = streaming and analysing real time data at scale, e.g. financial transactions, social media streams
    Data Pipeline = service that allows to move data from one place to another, eg. move data from S3 to DynamoDB
    Quick Sight = busienss analytics tool (BI) dashboards for analyzing business data 

IAM

    IAM
    Inspector
    Certificate Manager

    Cloud Formation - Infrastructure as Code
    Cloud Trail - auditing changes to your AWS environment
    OpsWorks - automating deployments using Chef
    Config - automatically monitors environments
    Service Catalog - large enterprises
    Trusted Advisor

Application Services

    Step Functions
    SWF - Simple Workflow Service, coordinates workflows between human and machine (Amazon fulfillment centre)
    API Gateway - door for apps to access backend data
    AppStream - streaming desktop applications to users
    Elastic Transcoder - changes video formats for all different devices

Developer Tools

    CodeCommit - github
    CodeBuild - compiling code
    CodeDeploy - deploy code to EC2 instances
    CodePipeline - version control of code (dev, test, prod, etc)

Mobile Services

    Mobile Hub
    Cognito - user sign up and sign in
    Device Farm
    Mobile Analytics
    PinPoint - google analytics for mobile applications  combined with targeted marketing campaigns

Business Productivity

    WorkDocs
    WorkMail

IoT 

    IoT

Desktop & App streaming

    WorkSpaces - virtual desktops 
    AppStraem 2.0 - streaming desktop apps to users

Artificial Intelligence

    ML (Machine Learning) - datasets and predictions
    Lex - backbone of Alexa
    Polly - text to voice, different voices and languages
    Recoknition - image classification, facial recognition

Messaging

    SNS - Simple Notification Service, email, txt, publish to HTTP endpoints
    SQS - Decoupling applications, simple queue service, job queue, no tightly coupled dependencies
    SES - simple email service
